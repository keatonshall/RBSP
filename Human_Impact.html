  <p>Humans have a big impact on Rock Bridge State Park, both for good and bad.</p>

  <h2 id="Negatives">Negatives</h2>
  <p>Like many other parts of nature, humans have a mostly negative impact on the park and the cave. The cave system, or the underground streams running through the caves, may seem isolated from the world above them, but there are many ways that actions down on land can affect what gets into the cave systems. One of the most frequent ways this happens is <a href="Topography.html#Sinkholes">sinkholes</a>. Since they expose sections of the caves to the open air, it is simple for pollution to get into the cave through these openings. Since a lot of natural water gets polluted by humans, the cave system gets polluted when this water gets into the caves through sinkholes. Many other objects can arrive in the cave system as a result of sinkholes. These objects can harm the caves in a similar way to the polluted water. </p> <div id="Hogs Graveyard"></div><p>One example of this happening is Hogs Graveyard. Hogs Graveyard is a very large sinkhole in RBSP. A while ago, farmers would put dead hogs into the sinkhole instead of properly burying them. Fortunately for the farmers, it was much easier than burying them. Unfortunately for wildlife, the dead organisms polluted the cave water below the sinkhole. Another way that humans impact the park is vandalizing things. Besides defacing the historical silos located on the land, there are many places where people have vandalized inside the caves. This takes away from the enjoyment of the resources from other humans. This can also directly affect nature such as breaking the structures in the caves called speleothems among other things.</p> <div id="wns"></div><p>Finally, hundreds of bats are dying each year from a deadly disease called white nose syndrome which is a fungus causing bats to wake up in the winter when they donâ€™t have any food. The way that humans come into the situation is that humans can easily transmit this fungus which makes it spread easier. There are, however, ways for humans to explore the caves without transmitting the disease. One of the ways this can be done is making sure to decontaminate any items brought into a cave. A portion of the spread of the disease can be attributed to humans retracting the fungus in caves on their clothes or gear such as flashlights. If these contaminants make it into a different cave, it is possible that the fungus could be spread into a new group of bats.

  <h2 id="Positives">Postives</h2>
  <p>Though humans impact the park in many negative ways, there are also ways that we are helping the area. By studying the wildlife, we can better understand it and help it in positive ways such as preserving nature through a variety of means.
