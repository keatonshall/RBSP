  <p>Besides Sinkhole Trail and its many histoical events, the founding of the park itself is very uniqe.</p>

  <h2 id="Beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>The Rock Bridge State Park is full of an interesting history ever since it was inhabited by the Paleo-Indians. The second group of people to come to the area were settlers who crossed the Rock Bridge into the park area in the early 1800s. During this time, the streams running throughout the park provided power for many machines. The most notable are the paper mills which made paper, grist mill which crushed grain to make flour, and a whiskey distillery. All of this activity was centered around Pierpont (French for “Rock Bridge”).

  <h2 id="Road">Road to State Park</h2>


<p>The area now known as Rock Bridge State Park wasn’t always owned by the state. As stated before, the land was mostly inhabited by Paleo-Indians. In 1924, Dennis Ingrum and his wife Naomi Ingrum had ownership over the land. Many people would gather underneath the Rock Bridge because it had a consistent temperature and made a great spot for activities. The Ingrum kids would give tours of their parents area which would eventually be sold to the state. When the Ingrunms still owned the park, a young 9 year old girl named Carol Louise Stoerker died in a car accident. Carol’s father, along with others, wanted to create a place for kids to be in nature. Many people donated to the cause and they eventually raised $175,000 ($1,590,000 in today’s dollars) by 1962. The state also contributed to the funds and matched this amount. The Ingrums later sold the park to the state in February 1967 and it has
 been considered a state park since.
