    <h2 id="Sinkholes">Sinkholes</h2>
<p>Rock Bridge State Park is full of very interesting topography, or the landscape and formations. If you go to RBSP, you’ll notice many large holes into the ground. These holes are called sinkholes and are caved in portions of the ground. Since RBSP is above a large cave system, its ground is less stable and can cave in more easily. This happens when the rock is <a href="Weathering_Erosion.html#Erosion">eroded</a> away and there isn't enough to support the land, making it fall (sink) in. Once the land has caved in, it becomes an opening into the cave straight down. Because of the sinkholes, many new things can get introduced into the cave system that weren’t previously there.

A good example of this is the story of Hogs Graveyard.  You can find out more about human impacts <a href="/Human_Impact.html#Hogs Graveyard"> here</a>. Now, Hogs Graveyard is fenced off to prevent anybody from coming close and possibly getting hurt.

<h2 id="Karst Topography">Karst Topography</h2>
<p>One way to describe the topography of RBSP is karst topography. Karst topography refers to land with many caves, sinkholes, and underground streams. These features are very hard to miss and can be found very quickly. </p>
<p>Here are many pictures showing the Karst Topography of RBSP</p>
