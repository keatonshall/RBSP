<p>One of the biggest attractions in RBSP are the caves. Two of these caves are Conner’s Cave and Devil’s Icebox. Devil’s Icebox has over seven miles of known passage, and is currently closed in the effort to protect the bats. Find out more about this <a href="Human_Impact.html#wns">here</a>. Many people admire the cave system far underground at the state park, but the gradual formation makes the structure even more amazing. </p>
<h2 id="Limestone">The Formation of Limestone</h2>
<p>The caves in RBSP, like those all around the state, are made up of limestone. The area that is now RBSP used to be in shallow sea water. When animals or other marine life die, their body starts the process of decomposition. Over time, these chemicals eventually form limestone formations that the caves we see today are made out of.</p>

<h2 id="Hollowing">Hollowing out</h2>
<p>
After the limestone was created, the sea level lowered and the limestone got buried under soil made up of decomposed materials. When it rained, the water would seep into the ground, interacting with the soil as it did so. In this interaction, a chemical  reaction occurs and the H<sub>2</sub>O (Water from the rain) and CO<sub>2</sub>  (Carbon dioxide from the soil) combine to form carbonic acid or H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Under the ground, there is a water table, or the boundary where water begins to saturate sediments. The carbonic acid seeps through the ground above the water table quickly and doesn’t form any significant channels, but once it reaches the water table, something else happens. When this chemical reaches the water table, it starts to eat away at the limestone forming channels. It tends to do this using the natural cracks and angles within the limestone. Since the hollowed out area is still under the water table, more water fills it and the decaying of the material due to carbonic acid happens even faster. Eventually, a large area can be carved away from the limestone leaving a big cavity of water.

<h2 id="Finish">A Mostly Finished Cave</h2>
<p>Overtime, the water table begins to lower. This leaves an opening underground full of air. This is what we call a cave.</p>

<h2 id="Spel">
The Forming of Speleothems (Cave Formations)
</h2>
<p>If you are lucky enough to see Conner's Cave for yourself, you’ll notice the many pointed figures coming from all angles. Amazingly, these objects are completely natural and take a long time to grow to what they are. Even though the water level has lowered and the cave has mostly stopped expanding, many things are still formed at this time. As rainwater and snowmelt dissolves into the top layers of limestone, a reaction occurs. It makes its way down to the cave ceiling and a droplet of dissolved limestone falls. Part of this drop clings onto the ceiling while part of it falls to the ground directly below it. Because the water makes its way down into the cave in a similar way each time due to the small channels, this dissolved limestone drips over and over in the same spot, eventually building up to form speleothems, or cave formations. Those that are made from the dissolved limestone clinging to the ceiling are called stalactites and hang down from the ceiling, while those that are formed when the limestone drips to the ground are called stalagmites and poke up from the ground. There are also many different kinds of each of these, each with interesting and creative names. Additionally, since stalagmites are right under stalactites, they can grow and meet given enough time. These special formations are called columns. Other formations are made in mostly similar ways.</p>

<h2 id="grow">Continuing to grow</h2>
<p>Even after the water table has lowered, the cave can still change shape and expand. This can happen when water flows through the cave and erodes away at the rock.</p>
<h2 id="bridge">The Rock Bridge</h2>
<p>Besides Conner’s Cave and Devil’s Icebox, another major natural attraction at RBSP is the Rock Bridge. After all, that’s where the name comes from. Originally, the Rock Bridge was connected to the rest of the cave system but collapsed and now stands alone. This is an example of weathering and erosion, find out more <a href="Weathering_Erosion.html#Weathering">here</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="fossils">Fossils</h2>

<p>Within RBSP, there are many fossils of wide variety. One of these fossils is crinoid fossils and they can tell us really important information about the past. Crinoids are animals, though they are sometimes referred to as sea lilies. They have survived many millions of years and many mass extensions. Crinoids look like flowers with many tentacle-like features. Crinoids live in shallow sea water. When it dies, some of its remains can be fossilized and fused into the limestone covered land around RBSP. As said before, we can easily find crinoid fossils in the area, so they must have previously lived there. Since the animal lives in shallow water, we can conclude that the area that is now RBSP used to be in shallow sea water. Crinoids are still alive today, though they have evolved a lot over their long lifetime. </p>
