  <h2 id="Weathering">Weathering</h2>
  <p>Weathering is the breaking apart of sediment such as rock, pebbles, silt, clay, and others. There are two types of weathering, mechanical and chemical. </p>

  <h3 id="Mech">Mechanical</h3>
<p>Mechanical weathering is when sediment gets broken apart without the chemical makeup changing. In RBSP, this can happen in a variety of ways. One way is when ice breaks apart rock when it freezes and expands, called frost wedging. This can cause separation and weakening of rock as shown in the picture below. Another similar way in which rock can get broken apart is root wedging. When roots grow, they can, over time, break rocks apart and weaken it. Another way in which mechanical weathering can occur is heat expansion. When rocks get really hot, such as being struck by lightning, the rock expands and layers of the rock can break apart.</p>

  <h3 id="Chem">Chemical</h3>
  <p>Besides mechanical weathering, there is also chemical weathering in which the chemical compound of the rock changes. One of these chemical changes is oxidation which is the reaction of oxygen with a material and a chemical reaction occurs. This reaction can change the appearance of the rock. For example, iron turns red and copper turns green when oxidation occurs. Another type of chemical weathering is acid dissolving objects. For example, as described <a href="Geology.html#Hollowing">here</a>, carbonic acid can slowly dissolve limestone.
</p>

<h2 id="Erosion">Erosion</h2>
<p>Weathering must occur before erosion. Erosion is the movement of sediment after it has been broken down (Weathering).   This can happen in four ways though only three of these happen as RBSP. Firstly, water from things like rain, rivers, and waves(No waves in RBSP) can pick things up and move them around. Another type of erosion is wind, which can move small sediments such as soil and sand. Gravity is also a type of erosion. Gravity makes things fall. When rock is loose, it is easier to fall and things like avalanches, caused by gravity, can happen. The last type of erosion, which doesnâ€™t happen in present day RBSP, is moving ice and glaciers. When glaciers move gradually, it can drag things underneath it and move it.</p>
